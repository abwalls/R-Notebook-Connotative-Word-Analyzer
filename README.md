R Notebook analysing the employee reviews from FAANG companies found on Glassdoor.com by comparing the words used in 
description to a loosely compiled dictionary of words with either a positive or negative connotation associated.  This 
is by no means a conclusive analysis as words are not checked for negation (i.e. not happy, never depressing) and other 
factors, but shouldnâ€™t provide much of an advantage to any specific company over another.
