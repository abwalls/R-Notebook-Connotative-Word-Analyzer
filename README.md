R Notebook analysing the employee reviews from FAANG companies found on Glassdoor.com by comparing the words used in 
description to a loosely compiled dictionary of words with either a positive or negative connotation associated.  Uses binary search to compare word values, but for much larger datasets you will want to use a hash table to lookup wordbank values for Θ(1) lookup instead of Θ(log n).This 
is by no means a conclusive analysis as words are not checked for negation (i.e. not happy, never depressing), old data, and other factors. This shouldn’t provide much of an advantage to any specific company over another so take from it what you will.
